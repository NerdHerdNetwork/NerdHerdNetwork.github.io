My name is Jake Podraza, I go by Hex on social media but it's not very unique so in most places I am HexTheNerd. I am a cofounder of the Nerd Herd even if Frank likes to say he was the sole founder.

Most of the time I am farming triumphs in Destiny or grinding my soul away in World of Warcraft, but I make the odd project here and there for the Nerd Herd. I am currently as student at University of California, Santa Cruz and I am studying to be a Computer Engineer.
