I've been working on developing and improving the combat system, and the only way to truly test the combat by fighting something. The enemies currently are static pill-looking things that don't do anything. Other than being a slight allegory for myself, they don't do much. This update is going to be improving the enemies slightly. Both giving them the ability to move, and then by giving them the ability to attack.
