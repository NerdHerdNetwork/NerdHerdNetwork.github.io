So I spent the last week or so learning how to use Jekyll and how the [**Minimal Mistakes Theme**](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes){:target="_blank"}. Now all of the content from the HTML-Based site should be converted. The last version of the website was written entirely in HTML, and because of that it was incredibly hard to update. Adding another page to the navigation bar would take updating every single file since the header was baked into every page. Now it should be much easier to update the website.

I updated the landing pages to be more appealing. The links to them have no `.html` at the end which is more professional. There are images and download links with very little information on the landing pages. There are links to the project pages, which is where I write about projects in a longer form.

Lastly, I can make posts. I can easily add a post about a video I put out so it's easier to follow projects. I will be updating this site's ability to sort, search, and follow projects in the future. That will come later, for now I will work on other things.

Best,
Frank
