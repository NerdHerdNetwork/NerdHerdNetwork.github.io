I just released a video on my personal channel which showcases me rebuilding the CSGO Prop and remove some unrealized software components. There are no significant enough updates to warrant a change to the project page, since this is just a rebuild. no components have changed. Hope you enjoy the video, subscribing and liking the video help me out a lot.
